## ‚ú® Features

This application is packed with features designed to provide a rich and seamless user experience:

- **Dynamic Quote Loading:** Quotes are fetched asynchronously from an external `quotes.json` file, keeping the data separate from the application logic.
- **Random Quote Display:** Click the "New Quote" button to display a random quote from the collection.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the current quote and author to your clipboard with a single click. Visual feedback is provided upon a successful copy.
- **Tweet a Quote:** Share the inspiration! The "Tweet" button opens a new Twitter window with the quote pre-populated and ready to be shared.
- **Interactive Author Information:**
  - Click on an author's name to open a detailed modal popup.
  - The modal displays a short biography, the author's title (e.g., "Philosopher," "President"), and their lifespan.
  - The author's name in the modal is a direct link to their Wikipedia page for further reading.
  - Includes clickable country flags that link to the respective country's Wikipedia page. Handles multiple nationalities.
- **Persistent State:** The application uses `localStorage` to remember the last quote you viewed, so when you return to the page, you'll pick up right where you left off.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
- **User Feedback:** The application provides clear loading states when fetching quotes and displays friendly error messages if the data fails to load.
