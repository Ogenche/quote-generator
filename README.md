## Features

- **Multi-Language Support**:
  - Toggle between English and Swahili with a single click.
  - The entire UI, including quotes, author details, and button text, updates instantly.
  - The user's language preference is saved in localStorage for their next visit.
- **Dynamic Quote Loading**: Quotes and their translations are fetched asynchronously from an external `quotes.json` file (keeps data and logic separate).
- **Dark/Light Mode**: A theme toggle (üåô/üåû) allows users to switch between a clean light theme and an eye-friendly dark theme. The user's preference is saved in `localStorage`.
- **Quote History**: Never lose a great quote again! Users can click the "Previous" button to revisit the last few quotes they've viewed.
- **Favorite Quotes System**:
  - Users can "like" a quote by clicking the heart icon (‚ô•Ô∏è), saving it to a personal favorites list.
  - Can save English and Swahili versions of the same quote separately.
  - The heart icon (‚ô•Ô∏è) accurately reflects the favorite status for the currently viewed language.
  - All favorite quotes are stored persistently in `localStorage` and are vieweble in a dedicated modal.
  - A dedicated modal allows users to view and manage their collection of saved quotes.
- **Interactive Author Information**:
  - Click on an author's name to open a detailed modal with their biography, title, and lifespan.
  - The modal includes a direct link to the author's Wikipedia page for further reading.
  - Country flags link to the respective Wikipedia pages and can handle multiple nationalities.
- **Modern UI & UX**:
  - **Animations**: Subtle fade transitions for new quotes, a scale-up effect for modals, and hover micro-interactions on buttons create a fluid user experience.
  - **Typography**: Uses Google Fonts (Merriweather and Poppins) for high readability and aesthetic appeal.
  - **Design**: Features a modern card-based design with soft shadows and a cohesive color palette for both light and dark themes.
- **Responsive & Accessible**:
  - The layout is fully responsive and looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
  - ARIA roles and keyboard navigation (e.g., `Esc` to close modals) are implemented for better accessibility.
- **Shareability**:
  - **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the current quote with a single click.
  - **Tweet a Quote**: The "Tweet" button opens Twitter with the quote pre-populated and ready to share.
